# Tune GPT Consulting

## Objective 

We will fine-tuning GPT with your expertise and data to make you an AI language classifier prototype.

## Context

On March 1, OpenAI announced the release of API access to ChatGPT.

What's does this mean for your company?

The cost to develop a prototype langauge based prediction service has dropped by
orders or magnitude -- in other words, new project experiments are now feasible with the new automation tool.

Below is a quiz for those already working on a langauge classification feature.


- Do you have a working design doc explaining your domain model (ie., subject matter expert's mental model?
- Are you continually narrowing the scope of your classifier as you find edge cases that are too expensive to solve at the moment?
- Are you experimenting with GPT instead of rolling your on language ML model?
- Are you experimenting with GPT, which is a hosted service, before jumping into MLOps work?
- Are you experimenting with GPT before you start human labeling (annotation)?


If you answer no to any of these questions above we think you are headed in the
wrong direction.
