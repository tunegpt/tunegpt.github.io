# Tune GPT Consulting

## Objective 

We will fine-tuning GPT with your expertise and data to make you an AI language classifier prototype.

## Context

On March 1, OpenAI announced the release of API access to ChatGPT.

What's does this mean for your company?

The cost to develop a prototype language based prediction service has dropped by
orders or magnitude -- in other words, new project experiments are now feasible with the new automation tool.

## Quiz

A quiz for those already working on a language classification feature.

- Are you experimenting with GPT instead of rolling your on language ML model?
- Are you experimenting with GPT, which is a hosted service, before jumping into MLOps work?
- Are you experimenting with GPT before you start human labeling (annotation)?
- Are you continually narrowing the scope of your classifier as you find edge cases that are too expensive to solve at the moment?
- Do you have a working design doc explaining your domain model (ie., subject matter expert's mental model?

If you answer no to any of these questions above, then we think you are headed in the
wrong direction.
