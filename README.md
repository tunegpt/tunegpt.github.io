**Fine-tune GPT to power your next AI feature.**

- We can make you a language classifier prototype.
- We can do a feasibility analysis on your language AI ideas.

**What's changed?**

On March 1, OpenAI announced the release of API access to ChatGPT.

**What's does this mean for your company?**

The cost to develop a language based prediction service has dropped by orders of magnitude. 

- What information gathering toil is suddenly feasible for you to automate?
- How can fine-tuning GPT jump start your current ML language classifier project?

**The CTO's four point pre-flight safety check**

1. Do you continuously update a high-level design document (Rosetta Stone) as you reach consensus on translating the mental model of your subject matter experts?
2. Do you continuously narrow the scope when you find edge cases that are too expensive to solve using AI, at the moment, or can be solved with cheap expert rules?
3. Prior to investing in a human labeling service, did you experiment with GPT chain prompting, vector indexing, and fine-tuning with programmatic labeling? 
4. Prior to investing in rolling your own language model, did you do a cost benefit analysis on using a hosted language model or a hybrid approach?
