# Tune GPT Consulting

## Objective 

We will fine-tune GPT to make you an AI language classifier prototype, if its
feasible.

## Context

On March 1, OpenAI announced the release of API access to ChatGPT.

What's does this mean for your company?

The cost to develop a prototype language based prediction service has dropped by
orders or magnitude. 

What does this mean?

- New automation that was previously not feasible might now be feasible.
- Your competitors have a new tool to beat you.
- You current language classifier project might need to be restructured.


## Quiz

Take this quiz if you are already working on a language classification feature.

- Did you start rolling your on language ML model before experimenting with GPT?
- Did you jump into MLOps work before experimenting with GPT?
- Did you start human labeling (annotation) before experimenting with GPT?
- Are you continually narrowing the scope of your classifier as you find edge cases that are too expensive to solve at the moment?
- Do you have a working design doc explaining your domain model (ie., subject matter expert's mental model?

If you answer no to any of these questions above, then we think you might be headed in the
wrong direction.
