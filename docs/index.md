**Fine-tune GPT to power your next AI feature.**

- We can make you a language classifier prototype.
- We can do a feasibility analysis on your language AI ideas.

**What's changed?**

On March 1, OpenAI announced the release of API access to ChatGPT.

**What's does this mean for your company?**

The cost to develop a language based prediction service has dropped by orders of magnitude. 

- What information gathering toil is suddenly feasible for you to automate?
- How can fine-tuning GPT jump start your current ML language classifier project?

**The CTO's four point pre-flight safety check**

1. Do you have a high-level, living, design document (Rosetta Stone) to reach consensus on a translation of your subject matter expert's mental model?
2. Do you continuously narrow the scope when you find edge cases that are too expensive to solve using AI at the moment or can be solved with cheap expert rules?
3. Did you experiment with GPT chain prompting, vector indexing, and fine-tuning with programmatic labeling?
4. Did you do a cost benefit analysis between a hosted language model versus rolling your own language model or a hybrid approach?
