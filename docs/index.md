**Fine-tune GPT to power your next AI feature.**

- We can make you a language classifier prototype.
- We can do a feasibility analysis on your language AI ideas.

**What's changed?**

On March 1, OpenAI announced the release of API access to ChatGPT.

**What's does this mean for your company?**

The cost to develop a language based prediction service has dropped by orders of magnitude. 

- What information gathering toil is suddenly feasible for you to automate?
- How can fine-tuning GPT jump start your current ML language classifier project?

**Checklist**

- Will you experiment with GPT before you start rolling your on language ML model? 
- Will you experiment with GPT, which is hosted, before you start MLOps work?
- Will you experiment with GPT before you start human labeling (annotation)?
- Are you continually narrowing the scope of your classifier as you find edge cases that are too expensive to solve at the moment?
- Will you have a working design doc explaining your domain model (ie., subject matter expert's mental model) before you start experiments?

If you answered no to any of these questions above, then you might be headed in the wrong direction.
